The app is currently all in the directory 'webapp'. With more time I'd move it to be in two directories as asked for. (So currently webservice is useless.)


To run the whole app in dev mode:
1) install the latest version of node.js
2) add your api key to the file 'webapp/api/index.js'
3) install yarn if it's not already installed: "npm install --global yarn"
4) cd into webapp
5) run the command: "yarn install"
6) run the command: "yarn dev"
